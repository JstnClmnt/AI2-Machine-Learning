# AI2-Machine Learning

<br> This project is a revised problem on our [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2018 Entry](https://github.com/JstnClmnt/SpaceApps)</br>
<br> I used 14 features to classify the habitability of a planet:</br>
* Orbital Period (days) 
* Planet-Star Distance over Star Radius
* Planet-Star Radius Ratio
* Fitted Stellar Density (g/cm^3)
* Planetary Radius (relative to Earth's radii)
* Orbital Semi-Major Axis (AU)
* Planet's Equilibrium Temperature (K)
* Insolation Flux (relative to Earth's Flux)  
* Number of Planets orbiting the Host Star
* Stellar Effective Temperature (K)
* Stellar Surface Gravity
* Stellar Metallicity (dex)
* Stellar Radius (relative to the Solar radii)
* Stellar Mass (relative to the Solar mass)

I did a comparison on varoous machine learning algorithms, specifically: *K-Nearest Neighbor*, *Support Vector Machines*, *Decision Trees*
